# Absurd_Data_Science_for_Sanctity_Detox
Predicting meme stock prices using cat moods, Reddit sentiment, lunar phases, and weather vibes. Because they might meowtter.

Stage 1 – Setup & Scene Setting

    Create GitHub repo with README &MIT license
    Make a README template with project description
    Add .gitignore & basic folder structure (data/, notebooks/, src/)

Stage 2 – Data Gathering
    Download cat images (10–20 minimum, Kaggle or manual)
    Get stock price history for at least 1 meme stock (GME/AMC)
    Fetch moon phase data (API or mock data)
    Fetch weather data (API or mock data)
    Gather Reddit WallStreetBets text data (real or pre-collected sample)

Stage 3 – Cat Mood Detector

    Load pre-trained CNN (MobileNet, ResNet, etc.)
    Assign absurd labels: Bullish, Bearish, Neutral
    Run classification on cat images
    Save results as cat_mood_score.csv

Stage 4 – Meme Text Sentiment

    Load HuggingFace sentiment model
    Analyze text captions/posts
    Save results as text_sentiment_score.csv

Stage 5 – Absurd Feature Fusion

    Merge cat mood, text sentiment, moon phase, weather, and stock prices into one DataFrame
    Create correlation heatmap (even if it makes no sense)

Stage 6 – Prediction Engine

    Train a regression/classification model to predict next-day price movement
    Save model & a few example predictions

Stage 7 – Visualization Overload

    Plot stock trends colored by moon phase or cat mood
    Make cat mood pie chart
    Generate at least 2 ridiculous graphs for README

Stage 8 – Final Touch

    Add all visuals & sample outputs to README
    Commit + push to GitHub
